* Work History
** Principal Engineer, [[http://www.sonian.com][Sonian]] (Apr 2010-Present)
   - Cloud-based document archiving.  Started in 2006-2007.  Received $10M
     round B funding in early 2011 led by Amazon.
*** SAFE Backend Engineer
    - Spent a year on the SAFE archive team.  It is a backend which processes
      imports from various protocols, loads the data to efficient, proprietary,
      long-term storage based on S3.  It then indexes the data to ElasticSearch
      on EC2/EBS.  Application was one of the first large production Clojure
      codebases.
    - Wrote streaming HTTP upload to S3 using Ring.
    - Wrote a piece of the application which audited import events and stored
      metrics in Riak.  Riak was later removed from the infrastructure so this
      part of the project never fully materialized.
    - Improved ElasticSearch interaction in the codebase.  Implemented bulk
      indexing.  Wrote a utility for allocating indices based on account dataset
      size.
*** Team Lead, Cloud Search
    - Broke off SAFE team to specialize in search technology.
    - Formed team of three (including me) to spearhead migration and
      stabilization of 300TiB legacy data from failing Ferret-based system to
      multiple distributed, Lucene-based ElasticSearch clusters.  This scheme
      has allowed us to scale to a petabyte and currently planning for 3x this
      scale.
    - Ongoing work includes shoring up the ES infrastructure with custom Java
      plugins to meet security requirements, prevent cluster separation during
      heavy indexing, and refine operational tools to support large numbers of
      clusters.  Also separating indexing from the import system by an API that
      is institutional controlled to decouple ES upgrades from the rest of the
      infrastructure.
    - Wrote chef recipes for key search infrastructure components.  Closely
      collaborated with operations to fully automate deployments.
    - Almost daily experience diagnosing issues with distributed systems at the
      JVM level.
** Software Developer, [[http://www.notifymd.com][NotifyMD]] (Oct 2007-Apr 2010)
   - Healthcare telecom firm started in the 1990s to provide devices to
     physicians that aid call service.
   - Rebranded after the turn of the century away from proprietary hardware to
     a distributed call center model which works with existing phone system.
   - I conceived of and led a project to revamp a Coldfusion/SQL Server
     application that was showing its age.  I aggregated data from legacy SQL
     Server databases to a modern SOLR-based search application.  Began the
     project in Python in 2007 but adopted Clojure shortly after it was released
     to the public later that year.  Allowed me to quickly build an application
     that pulled archive data in parallel from the RDBMSes and serialize to
     Clojure s-expressions for fast reindexing.
   - Implemented one-touch deployment for all apps in multiple environments.
   - Designed and managed local DNS powered by [[http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html][djbdns]] to support dev operations.
** Lead Developer, [[http://www.cabedge.com][Cabedge]] (Apr 2006-Oct 2007)
   - Typical agency-style boutique design shop.  They hired me in part to
     transition their small development team to Ruby on Rails.  I worked on a
     few dozen web applications including e-commerce, custom CMS frameworks,
     and brochures, often discussing requirements directly with clients.
     Eventually gave up on Ruby's performance issues and moved us to Django
     with great success.
** Systems Analyst, [[http://www.vanderbilt.edu][Vanderbilt University]] (Sep 2003-Apr 2006)
   - Systems Implementation & Development team.
   - Lead developer of project to integrate Proofpoint filter software into
     university's 60,000-mailbox IMAP/sendmail environment.
** Software Systems Specialist, [[http://www.vanderbilt.edu][Vanderbilt University]] (Feb 2001-Sep 2003)
   - Primary role was a Solaris/Linux sysadmin.
   - Maintained a dozen shared Solaris workstations (Ultra 30s/60s) with an
     E450 serving NFS, email, etc.
   - Migrated mail system from sendmail/UW-IMAP to qmail & Courier IMAP.
** Technical Support Consultant, [[http://www.vt.edu][Virginia Tech]] (1996-1999)
   - Worked part-time through school.
   - Provided primarily network support over the phone to entire campus
     community.  This was on the cusp of Ethernet becoming a standard and
     before computers shipped with an interface on the motherboard!
   - Supported nameless PCs to Macintosh OS 6-9
   - Performed occasional housecalls
   - Shared a building with the core university datacenter and a gaggle of
     Internet veterans who helped me cut my teeth on Unix/Linux.
